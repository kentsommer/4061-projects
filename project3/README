1. How to compile your program
  a) To compile the whole project, simply run: make
  b) To compile and run the tests, simply run: make test
  c) To clean up compiled files when done run: make clean
  
  
2. How to use the program from the shell (syntax)
  To run the packet receiver and sender:
    a) In one shell (in the project directory) (x is the number of messages you want)
        run: ./packet_sender x 
    b) In one shell (in the project directory) (x is the number of messages you want)
        run: ./packet_receiver x 
        
  
3. What exactly your program does (briefly)
  a) packet_sender.c
    i) Creates a message, opens a message queue and places the message in the queue in split up packets
  b) packet_receiver.c
    i) Receives the packets from packet_sender (the queue) then assembles them to create the message
  c) mm.c
    i) Functions: Allocate memory for a mm_t var, get a chunk of memory
        return a chunk of memory back, free allocated memory
